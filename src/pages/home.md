<h2 class="title">Automotive SEO consultant</h2>

Hey, I'm Cameron Koester (pronounced kes-ter). Here's a little bit about me:

- I'm an SEO consultant specializing in the automotive industry. I help car dealers and other automotive businesses perform better on search engines like Google and Bing. I have worked with AutoNation for almost a decade, growing their portfolio of over 250 websites.
- I've been a car enthusiast for as long as I can remember. I love driving, geeking out over vehicle specs and features, and attending car events. I've owned a BMW Z3 M Coupe and VW Golf R (mk6).
- Other hobbies I enjoy include running, trying to get better at golf, and learning more about coding and website development.
- I currently live in sunny Scottsdale, Arizona, with my girlfriend and Samoyed dog Humphrey.
- This is my personal website, where I share what I'm up to and whatever is on my mind. You can check out my latest posts here on [my blog](/blog/).
