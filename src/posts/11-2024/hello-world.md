title: Hello world!
---

I have launched my own personal website! I’ve wanted to do this for a while but kept getting distracted by different website platforms and designs and planning what it could become. Finally, I decided that just starting from scratch with a very simple site and then building it up more organically is the way to go.

I've wanted to start my own site for the same reason I think everyone should have their own website: it's a digital hub you own and control. Although social media is great for reach and exposure, the platforms can be fickle and not something I want to rely on long term. But a personal website like this can be the source of information about me and a place to share my thoughts indefinitely.

Aside from being my official online hub, I'm hope to use this site to connect with other like-minded people. Some of the things I'm going to be posting about include:

- Car industry news and new model releases
- Cool cars I find for sale
- SEO and digital marketing insights
- Reviews of products I am using or places I've been
- Any other life updates or things I'm thinking about

If you happen to stumble upon this post or anything else I’ve shared and like it, do [reach out](/contact/)! Otherwise, stay tuned to see what else I decide to do with this site. I’m excited to finally have it live and start playing around with it for real.
